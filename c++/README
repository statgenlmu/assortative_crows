HOW TO RUN THESE PROGRAMS

./hybridzone_simulator 2.7 0.3 0.4 xyz_ selection
runs the simulation with selection model (just leave out the selection flag to
run neutral model) with assortativity parameters 2.7 and 0.3 (the latter being
the threshold) and initial western locus 2 d allele frequency of 0.4.
It writes two output files xyz_finfreqs.csv and xyz_simres.csv .

./hybridzone_simulator 2.7 0.3 0.4 xyz_ selection additive
runs as above but with additive genetic architecture for color. (Only works
with selection as 5th and additive as 6th option)

 ./genotype_llh xyz_finfreqs.csv 2.7 0.3 data.txt selection
then calculates the log likelihoods for a range of initial contact points

The data file data.txt must contain a head line with the names of six columns
followed by a line for each bird. The six blank-separated columns must contain
for each bird (or its sampling site) the latitude, the longitude,
the distance along the transect from the most western point of the range,
the nest ID, the genotyple (0, 1 or 2) at locus 1 and the genotype at locus 2.
