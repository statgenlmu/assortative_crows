HOW TO RUN THESE PROGRAMS

./hybridzone_simulator 2.7 0.3 0.4 xyz_ selection
runs the simulation with selection model (just leave out the selection flag to
run neutral model) with assortativity parameters 2.7 and 0.3 (the latter being
the threshold) and initial western locus 2 d allele frequency of 0.4.
It writes two output files xyz_finfreqs.csv and xyz_simres.csv .

./hybridzone_simulator 2.7 0.3 0.4 xyz_ selection additive
runs as above but with additive genetic architecture for color. (Only works
with selection as 5th and additive as 6th option)

 ./genotype_llh xyz_finfreqs.csv 2.7 0.3 ../Data/data_central_red.txt selection
then calculates the log likelihoods for a range of initial contact points
